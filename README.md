# Hello! :computer: :keyboard: :bulb:

My name is João Paulo Freire, I'm Brazilian and I was born in 2005. I'm interested in programming, more specifically in front-end web. I completed the Systems Development technical course along with High School in December 2022 at Etec Rodrigues de Abreu, and I am currently studying Database Technology at Fatec de Bauru/SP, where I currently live. I don't work in this area (not yet 🙂), but I'm doing my best to learn and master programming languages ​​and apply them to business interests.
