# Hello! :computer: :keyboard: :bulb:

My name is Jo√£o Paulo Freire dos Santos, I'm Brazilian and i'm 18. I am interested in the programming area, more specifically, the web front-end part. I completed the Systems Development technical course along with High School in December 2022 at Etec Rodrigues de Abreu, in Bauru/SP, where I currently live. I don't work yet and I don't have professional experience in this area, but I'm doing my best to learn and master programming languages and apply them to business interests.
